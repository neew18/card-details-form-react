## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [react-hook-form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form)

### What I learned

In this project, I have learnt about Context api and form validation. And I can use useState more confidently. This is my first project to practice my tailwind knowledge and I find it more convenient than Bootstrap. 

### Continued development

I will learn and read more about context api and these form validation. Next I plan to study about React routes.

### Useful resources

- [Context api](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9WmZFnE6Hg) - This helped me for context api. He explained about it well.
- [Form validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LwETbBytJ0&t=908s) - This is an amazing youtube tutorial which helped me understand form validation in React. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
